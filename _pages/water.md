The ffem Water test kit are designed for testing drinking water and also for monitoring water in lakes and rivers. The current parameters are listed below.

* [pH](#ph)
* [Fluoride](#fluoride)
* [Nitrate](#nitrate)
* [Phosphate](#phosphate)
* [Copper](#copper)
* [Aluminum](#aluminum)
* [Arsenic III](#arsenic_iii)
* [Chromium VI](#chromium_vi)
* [Chloride](#chloride)
* [Sulphate](#sulphate)
* [Dissolved Oxygen](#dissolved_oxygen)
* [Chlorophyll A](#chlorophyll_a)

All tests work with the same base kit, with different consumables for each parameter. Tests are based on colorimetry, and the principle has been described in this paper: [Monitoring of fluoride in water samples using a smartphone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716301553). You can test for concentrations well above the limits mentioned in the ranges below, by diluting the sample with distilled or dionised water. The app allows for upto 5 times dilution. These dilutions do increase the error in a sample measurement.

### pH
_Range:_ 4 to 9<br>
_Cost per test:_ INR 5<br>
pH is a crucial water quality parameter, and is often the easiest to measure. The ffem water test kit uses **TODO** indicator to carry out colorimetric tests. Permissable drinking water range is 6.5 to 8.5.

<a name="fluoride"></a>
### Fluoride
_Range:_ 0ppm to 2ppm<br>
_Cost per test:_ INR 20<br>
Fluoride in drinking water is a health hazard in several parts of the world, and is a particular problem in India. The fem Fluoride test uses Zirconyl Xylenol Orange (a modified SPADNS) reagent to conduct the test. In India the permissable range for drinking water is 1ppm.

<a name="nitrate"></a>
### Nitrate
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20
Nitrate tests are conducted with two solid reagents. Permissable limits in India is upto 40ppm.

<a name="phosphate"></a>
### Phosphate
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20


<a name="copper"></a>
### Copper
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20

<a name="aluminum"></a>
### Aluminum
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20

<a name="arsenic_iii"></a>
### Arsenic III
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20

<a name="chromium_vi"></a>
### Chromium VI
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20

<a name="chloride"></a>
### Chloride
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20

<a name="sulphate"></a>
### Sulphate
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20

<a name="dissolved_oxygen"></a>
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20

<a name="chlorophyll_a"></a>
_Range:_ 0ppm to 100ppm
_Cost per test:_ INR 20
